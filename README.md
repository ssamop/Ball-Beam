# Ball-Beam
Ball &amp; Beam PID Control project developed as part of system &amp; control course.

This project in Systems and Control involves designing and implementing a PID controller and Lead-Lag compensator for a given 4th order feed-forward transfer function. The objective is to improve system responses, both transient and steady state. The project includes steps such as analyzing the system, designing PID and Lead-Lag controllers using MATLAB, building analog circuits, hardware implementation, and documentation. The evaluation comprises demonstrating hardware, explaining design choices, and submitting a comprehensive project report. 

## Let's break down the detailed steps for the Systems and Control project:

1. System Analysis:
Understand the given 4th order feed-forward transfer function G(s).
Derive the closed-loop transfer function assuming unity feedback.

2. PID Controller Design:
Use MATLAB to design PID controller parameters for specific performance criteria (maximum peak, settling time, and steady-state error).
Implement an analog circuit representing the PID controller with flexibility for P, PI, PD, or PID control.
Derive the closed-loop transfer function after inserting the PID controller.
Utilize MATLAB and Simulink for analysis, ensuring the designed controller meets performance requirements.

3. Lead-Lag Compensator Design:
Implement an analog circuit representing the Lead-Lag compensator with flexibility for Lead, Lag, or both.
Derive the closed-loop transfer function after inserting the Lead-Lag compensator.
Analyze the complete system using MATLAB and Simulink.

4. Hardware Implementation:
Construct the designed PID and Lead-Lag circuits in hardware.
Ensure the hardware implementation is flexible, allowing parameter changes for both controllers.
Validate the functionality of the hardware setup.

5. Documentation:
Prepare a comprehensive project report including:
Introduction and objectives.
System analysis.
PID controller design, implementation, and analysis.
Lead-Lag compensator design, implementation, and analysis.
Hardware implementation details.
Results and conclusions.
